A web application like reddit where users can post various content and interact and vote on it across several sub forums. The website is catered to CU students by prioritizing functionalities to find other students, communicate, and organize events. When a user makes an account they can post various content including text, images, polls, and links to the forum. The sub forums are intended for specific groups and clubs to manage content. The application is a user friendly forum page with easy navigation, filtering and searching. 
	The websiteâ€™s frontend will be created using html, css, and javascript to display posts, allow interaction, and provide user navigation options. This user interface will communicate with the backend to record and maintain information. The backend will use a PostgreSQL database to store user accounts and information and store posts and comments.
