### Application Description
A web application like reddit where uses can create posts with metadata including images, texts, and links.
It also may have special features that are specific to students such as additional functionality for creating events and sending messages depending on the time that we have.
There will be several sub forums that will be higher level data structures containing posts.
These sub forums will each be dedicated to discussion of a certain topic that users would find relevant.
Users will have the option to comment on posts as well as vote which will modify the underlying post data structures.
There will also be the option to create sub forums with specific topics.

The application is a user friendly forum page with easy navigation, filtering and searching allowing for interconnectedness between users of like minded interests.
For students, some of the additional functionality will allow users to meet other students, communicate, and organize events.
It is valuable for students to interact with one another to share and communicate easily.
The goal of our application is to connect students and other users in new ways that no other social media application has ever been able to accomplish. 

### Architecture Plan
The websiteâ€™s frontend and business logic will be created using React, Express, JavaScript, JSX, HTML, and CSS to display posts, allow interaction, and provide user navigation options.
This user interface will communicate with the backend to record and maintain information.
The backend will use a PostgreSQL database to store user accounts and information and store posts and comments.
